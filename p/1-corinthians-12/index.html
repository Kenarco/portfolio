The State of Spiritual Gifts</h1><p>Related to the subject of irregularities in the worship of the Corinthian church, was a question on the nature of spiritual gifts and their exercise in the public assembly. This subject should also be considered under the broader rubric of Christian freedom which Paul had been qualifying and regulating by the principle of love (starting with 8:1). The need for such regulation was certainly evident. A self-indulgent spirit, which debauched the principle of freedom in other areas, found similar expression in the area of spiritual gifts, and produced selfishness and disunity (12:7, 25; 14:4) and apparent chaos in the assembly (14:23, 33, 40)</p><p>Paul dealt with the problem by describing the nature and purpose of gifts (12:1‚Äì30), the superiority of love (12:31‚Äì13:13), and the regulating of the exercise of gifts by love (chap. 14). As in other areas, so in using gifts in the church, believers should promote the glory of God and the good of others instead of self-satisfaction.</p><p>(1) Unity and diversity of gifts (12:1‚Äì31a). 12:1‚Äì3. Before Paul began his discussion of spiritual gifts he thought it necessary to confront, at the outset, any in the Corinthian assembly who might contradict his message (cf. 14:37). It is probably in this regard that 12:3 is to be understood. Many explanations of the verse have been offered (though most commentators ‚Äúhandle‚Äù the problem by ignoring it).</p><p>Paul apparently believed that some of the Corinthians‚Äô problems were due not entirely to their worldly attitudes (3:3) but also to the presence of false teachers who preyed on their spiritual immaturity and exacerbated the problems. The pagan background out of which many had come (and some were still coming; cf. 8:10; 10:14, 20‚Äì21) did not help them ascertain the presence of false prophets. When they were pagans, they had been influenced and led astray to dumb idols (12:2). Certainly lifeless idols are totally helpless in such matters! (In the Corinthians‚Äô vaunted wisdom they showed themselves to be unusually gullible [cf. 2 Cor. 11:1‚Äì21, esp. 19‚Äì20].)</p><p>Paul therefore laid down a simple test related to the person of Christ. The false teachers obviously claimed that their visions, revelations, and messages (cf. 2 Cor. 12:1) were from God, but they apparently denied the humanity of Christ, as expressed by the words Jesus be cursed. This may have been a factor in the Corinthians‚Äô aversion to Paul‚Äôs ‚Äúmessage of the Cross‚Äù (1 Cor. 1:10‚Äì4:13). It may be surprising today to realize that the earliest Christological heresy (Docetism) denied Jesus‚Äô humanity, not His deity. John had to deal with the same problem years later (1 John 4:1‚Äì3).</p><p>Also Jesus who had suffered was now the Jesus who reigns as Lord, whom Paul represented (1 Cor. 1:1) and who was to be obeyed. Only believers, speaking by the Holy Spirit, acknowledge that Jesus is Lord. Nonbelievers‚Äîincluding false teachers‚Äîdeny His sovereign lordship. Thus anyone who tries to controvert Jesus‚Äô authority and His Word will suffer the consequences (14:38; 16:22).</p><p>12:4‚Äì6. Paul had referred to God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit in verse 3. Now in reverse order he stressed the unity of the Godhead in relation to the different spiritual gifts. The Holy Spirit gives a diversity of gifts (cf. ‚ÄúSpirit‚Äù in vv. 7‚Äì9, 11) so that individuals can serve the Lord and His body, the church, in various ways (cf. vv. 7, 27), all empowered by God and exercised under His aegis (cf. vv. 18, 24). Though there are different kinds (diaireseis) of gifts ‚Ä¶ service, and working, the same Spirit ‚Ä¶ the same Lord (Christ), and the same God are involved in all of them.</p><p>12:7‚Äì10. The gifts had a unity in source (vv. 4‚Äì6), and they also had a unity in purpose. They were given, not for personal enrichment (cf. 14:4; 1 Peter 4:10), but for the common good of the body of Christ, the building up of others (1 Cor. 10:24; 14:12). Paul listed some of the gifts here. Others, along with some of these, are given in Romans 12:6‚Äì8; 1 Corinthians 12:28‚Äì31; Ephesians 4:11; 1 Peter 4:10‚Äì11.</p><p>The list here includes nine gifts. (1) Wisdom refers to insight into doctrinal truth. Paul exercised and expressed this gift in this letter (e.g., 2:6). (2) Knowledge refers to the ability to apply doctrinal truth to life. Paul also exercised and expressed this gift in this letter (e.g., 12:1‚Äì3; 11:3). (Cf. the recurrence of the phrase ‚ÄúDo you not know‚Äù in 3:16; 5:6; 6:2‚Äì3, 9, 15‚Äì16, 19; 9:13, 24; also cf. 8:1‚Äì3, 10‚Äì11). (3) Faith as a spiritual gift is probably an unusual measure of trust in God beyond that exercised by most Christians (e.g., 13:2). (4) Healing is the ability to restore health (e.g., Acts 3:7; 19:12) and also to hold off death itself temporarily (Acts 9:40; 20:9‚Äì10). (5) Miraculous powers may refer to exorcising demons (Acts 19:12) or inducing physical disability (Acts 13:11) or even death (Acts 5:5, 9). (6) Prophecy is the ability, like that of the Old Testament prophets, to declare a message of God for His people (1 Cor. 14:3). (7) Ability to distinguish between spirits is the gift to differentiate the Word of God proclaimed by a true prophet from that of a satanic deceiver (cf. 2 Cor. 11:14‚Äì15; 1 John 4:1). If the Corinthians possessed this gift (cf. 1 Cor. 1:7), it was not being put to good use (cf. 12:1‚Äì3). (8) Tongues refers to the ability to speak an unlearned, living language (e.g., Acts 2:11). (9) Interpretation was the ability to translate an unlearned, known language expressed in the assembly (1 Cor. 14:27).</p><p>With the possible exception of faith, all these gifts seem to have been confirmatory and foundational gifts for the establishment of the church (cf. Heb. 2:4; Eph. 2:20) and were therefore temporary.</p><p>12:11. The gifts were not meant to be selected by individuals or personally solicited by them, but were instead given by the ‚Ä¶ Spirit ‚Ä¶ as He determined. ‚ÄúThe Spirit‚Äù is referred to six times in verses 7‚Äì11.</p><p>12:12. This verse forms an excellent three-part summary of the rest of the chapter. (a) The human body is a unit (cf. v. 13 on the unity of the body of Christ). (b) The human body has many parts, with a necessary diversity in its members (cf. vv. 14‚Äì20). (c) The parts of the human body work together as one, with a dependent mutuality as each part fulfills an important function (cf. vv. 21‚Äì26). Likewise the body of Christ has a diversity of parts functioning together.</p><p>12:13. The One who gave the diverse gifts, the Spirit, was also the medium in which, by which, and with which (possible translations of the Gr. preposition en; cf. Matt. 3:11) that unity exists. The baptism of the Spirit is experienced by all who believe, at the moment of salvation (cf. Rom. 8:9). In that baptism, believers, regardless of nationality (whether Jews or Greeks) or station of life (slave or free), are identified with Christ (baptized ‚Ä¶ into one body) and are indwelt by the Spirit (given the one Spirit to drink; cf. John 4:14; 7:38‚Äì39).</p><p>12:14‚Äì20. Different parts are needed if a body is to exist (v. 19). So too, no believer should think of himself or his gift as inferior and so desire another member‚Äôs gift. The gifts were not haphazardly distributed (cf. v. 11) but carefully arranged according to the perfect will of God (v. 18).</p><p>12:21‚Äì26. In the diversity of the bodily parts there was a corresponding mutual dependence. A person with a seemingly greater gift should not imagine that he could function alone since a bodily member cut off from the natural body would cease to exist. More importantly, one thought to possess a lesser gift should in fact be accorded greater attention by the other members of the body (cf. 14:1‚Äì5) just as in the natural body special deference in attention to dress is paid to those parts of the body deemed less presentable (12:22‚Äì24). Possibly Paul was reaching back in thought beyond the immediate discussion of gifts when he referred to weaker members (v. 22; cf. 8:7‚Äì13) and less honorable ones (12:23; cf. 11:22) who also required special care and consideration. This too was part of God‚Äôs plan (God ‚Ä¶ combined the members), that members of the spiritual body would demonstrate a mutual concern for the well-being of others (12:25b‚Äì26; 10:24, 33) so that rivalry would cease (so that there should be no division in the body; 1:10; 11:18) and genuine unity would exist (12:26).</p><p>12:27‚Äì31a. The unifying member in the spiritual body is Christ. As the Head (Eph. 1:22; cf. 1 Cor. 11:3) He possesses the body and sovereignly expresses His will. His command is that love should prevail among the members (John 15:12). This was the force which would maintain unity within the diversity and to this subject Paul would shortly move.</p><p>For a third time (cf. 12:18, 24, 28), however, Paul stressed the fact that God, not man, assigned the gifts. As he discussed another sample of gifts (some repeated from vv. 7‚Äì10 and some new), it was the members, the people so gifted, to whom he referred. Since the gifts included in the two lists in this chapter contain novelty and redundancy (which is the case elsewhere in passages detailing gifts, e.g., Rom. 12:6‚Äì8; Eph. 4:11; 1 Peter 4:10‚Äì11‚Äîthe gift of teaching being the only gift which appears in each list), probably no complete catalog existed.</p><p>The fact that Paul assigned ordinal numbers (first ‚Ä¶ second ‚Ä¶ third) to the first three gifts suggests that these may have been relegated to a lesser role by the Corinthians (cf. 1 Cor. 12:21‚Äì24). Those three kinds of gifted members‚Äîapostles ‚Ä¶ prophets ‚Ä¶ teachers‚Äîprobably were rated lower than those who had the more spectacular gift of tongues. But the first three gifts may have been greater (v. 31) because of their extensive value to the whole body of Christ. This may be why he listed them first and then said that the church should eagerly desire (v. 31) the exercise of those gifts in the assembly (cf. 14:1‚Äì5). Gifted apostles, prophets, and teachers characteristically ministered to a whole church, and so would engender unity and mutual edification. The gift of tongues, on the other hand, suited the Corinthian penchant for self-expression and the pursuit of personal freedom. This self-centeredness also afflicted the church in other areas (e.g., eating sacrificial foods, women in worship, celebration of the Lord‚Äôs Supper). Love for others was an essential need in the Corinthian church, and to that fundamental attribute Paul then turned to pay eloquent tribute.</p><p>(2) Superiority of love to all gifts (12:31b‚Äì13:13). 12:31b. Though Paul greatly valued spiritual gifts, he valued even more a quality of life which the Spirit produced. Spiritual gifts were variously apportioned to individuals in the church so that no single gift was possessed by every member (cf. vv. 19‚Äì30). On the other hand the Holy Spirit sought to produce the fruit of the Spirit in every Christian (Gal. 5:22‚Äì23), chief among which was love. This was more important than the gifts, and when displayed it would help correct the Corinthian aberrations which surrounded their possession and use of God‚Äôs gifts (cf. 1 Cor. 14:1).</p><p>The way Paul referred to was a manner of life preeminently characterized by love (cf. John 15:9‚Äì17). Jesus and John the Baptist followed this way of righteousness (Matt. 3:15; 21:32) by obediently practicing the will of God and exhorting their followers to do the same (Matt. 5:6, 10, 20; 6:33). This same manner of life and consequent conduct Paul called the way of love (1 Cor. 14:1; cf. Rom. 13:8‚Äì10), which he followed and exhorted the Corinthians to do the same (1 Cor. 14:1; cf. 11:1).</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/portfolio/tags/corinthians/>Corinthians</a>
